Please place your screenshot of the "enter line" area here.
Name the file: enter_line.png
The macro will look for this image on the screen to determine where to click.

Also, place a screenshot of the loading screen (or a unique part of it) here.
Name the file: lobby_change.png (or lobby_change_1.png, lobby_change_2.png, etc.)
The macro will use this to verify that the lobby change has started.

Finally, place a screenshot of the "Go" or "Enter" button here.
Name the file: go.png
The macro will click this button repeatedly if the initial Enter press fails to trigger the lobby change.
